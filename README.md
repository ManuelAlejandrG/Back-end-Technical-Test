This project is for a back-end test done by "MO Technologies".

For its recommended use, clone the repository, install the corresponding dependencies, do the migrations and run the project.

The first thing is to visit the url `/ pokemones` in your environment, so that the web application can store the corresponding data in the database.

Then, the section "Build a Command that receives as its only parameter an ID, representing
the Evolution Chain ", is found in the url` info / <id> / `where the id is the one indicated for the pokemon.

The section "Expose a Web Service which only parameter is the" name "of a Pokemon search", is found in the url `evolution / <name> /` where name is the one indicated for the pokemon.

The project has a simple HTML and CSS, which could be improved.
